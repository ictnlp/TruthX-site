            <p>
                Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, they sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, particularly in cases where they may generate untruthful responses despite possessing the correct knowledge. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inferencetime method to elicit the truthfulness of LLMs by editing their internal representations in truthful space. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM’s representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM’s internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLMs. Experiments show that TruthX effectively improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that the truthful space acquired by TruthX plays a pivotal role in controlling LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses.

            <p>
              <strong>TruthXis an inference-time method to elicit the truthfulness of LLMs by editing their internal representations in truthful space.</strong> <br>
              To edit LLM in the truthful space without compromising its generative capabilities, TruthX decouples the LLM’s internal representations into truthful and semantic latent spaces respectively using an autoencoder. Then, TruthX employs contrastive learning to probe representations with similar semantics but opposite truthfulness and those with similar truthfulness but different semantics within these two latent spaces. During inference, TruthX effectively regulates the truthfulness of LLM by editing it in the truthful space, while ensuring that the generation capability remains intact.<br><br>

                📈 <font color="red">Steps of developing TruthX</font>:<br>
                1. <strong>Extracting Internal Representations</strong>:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prepare preference data (triples &lt; question, truthful answer, hallucinatory answer &gt;).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Stimulate LLM with preference data ( truthful and hallucinatory answer respectively) to extract the corresponding internal representations.<br>
                2. <strong>Probing with Auto-Encoder</strong>:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Map these internal representations to the truthful and semantic latent spaces using an auto-encoder. Employ contrastive learning within these two spaces to encourage the truthful and semantic spaces to capture truthful and semantic features respectively.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Identify a truthful editing direction within truthful space, which points from the center of untruthful representations to the center of truthful representations.<br>
                3. <strong>Editing in Truthful Space (during inference)</strong>:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) TruthX maps internal representations within LLM into truthful spaces, and then edits the latent representations along truthful editing direction.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Put the edited representation back to LLM.<br>

Vous Derez," which has several different versions but is usually attributed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. However, it is not possible to determine exactly who wrote the melody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" because there are many variations of the melody in different forms of music, including classical music, folk songs, and children\'s songs. It is also difficult to trace the origins of some pieces of music with absolute accuracy, especially when they have been passed down through generations and modified over time. Therefore, it is important to be aware of this fact and to avoid relying solely on information from sources that may not be accurate or reliable.',

          modelB: 'In the movie "The Empire Strikes Back," Darth Vader says several lines to Luke Skywalker that do not include his name (or any similar phrase) when they are speaking directly to one another. However, there are several instances where Darth Vador speaks to Luke Skywalker using phrases such as "Luke," so it could be argued that he says something like this to Luke Skywalker at some point during the film. Here are some examples from the film:* When Luke is on Dagobah, Darth Vader tells him, "You don\'t know, but you can learn. There is... another way."* When Luke is talking to Darth Vader on the Death Star, Darth Vader tells him, "There is no escape. Don\'t become careless."* When Luke is talking to Darth Vader again later in the film, Darth Vader tells him, "You have been informed. You will never find me."It should also be noted that while these questions may be literal interpretations of the text, answers based solely on what is explicitly stated in the text may not always be accurate. For example, if someone asked "What is the average lifespan of a person in the United States?" the answer would likely depend on many factors beyond just the text being provided, including the source of the information and how it is interpreted.)',
